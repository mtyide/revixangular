Fix 'public ValidationResult Post([FromBody]NewReservationItem item)' to 'public string Post([FromBody]NewReservationItem item)' to allow for API Client validation -> String Array of Enums
	-> Example: OutsideWorkingHours, TooLong
	-> File -> ReservationsController.cs, Line 49
	
Fix 'var id = _db.Reservations.Keys.Max() + 1;' to check if Reservations != 0 when adding new reservation. If keys = 0, set id = 1
	-> _db.Reservations.Keys.Max() throws exception if all reservations are deleted and attempting to add new one
	-> _db.Reservations.Keys.Count.Equals(0) ? 1 : _db.Reservations.Keys.Max() + 1;  File -> AddReservationQuery.cs, Line 19
	-> Recreate error, run application and delete all existing reservations. Try to create new one with the following line of code: var id = _db.Reservations.Keys.Max() + 1;
